ROUTES WITH EXPRESS

The provided code sets up a basic Express application with routes for user authentication 
(creating users, logging in, deleting users) using a MongoDB database with Mongoose for schema
 modeling and bcrypt for password encryption. It also includes basic error handling and middleware
for input validation using the express-validator package. Additionally, the application uses
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication.
